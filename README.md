# ntlmbrutal
ntlmbrutal is a Python-based brute-force tool designed to test NTLM-enabled endpoints by attempting username and password combinations. The script leverages curl with NTLM authentication to send requests to a specified endpoint, and it identifies valid username/password pairs based on the size of the HTTP response.
